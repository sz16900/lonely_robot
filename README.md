This project was developed as part of the Bristol University Masters degree module - Software Engineering in 2017. 
The brief was to develop a video game to demystify Computer Science concepts (such as abstraction and object oriented design) 
to Key Stage 2 students.

When the robot approaches an object, a UI with code pops up. The user can manipilate the values in order to change the 
attributes of the object:
